==== SETUP ====

Grab a copy of VoicePro3 ver1.2.1 from here:
https://www.arexinc.co.jp/main/library/library.htm
(first link in the boxes)

You may also wish to download some sample wav files from
https://www.arexinc.co.jp/main/library/se.htm to a folder.

From VPro3_Prog.lzh, extract the following files
- Vp3Romf.exe
- COkiADPCM.dll
- ML2302.DLL
- English/Vp3_Manual.pdf (not required)
You won't need the rest of the files for this.

IMPORTANT: You need to patch Vp3Romf.exe to run without the AR207 hardware.
Open the exe file in a hex editor.
At 2F92C change byte from 74 to 75.
At 304FB change byte from 75 to 74.
Now the hardware check on launch is bypassed. Wave editor not patched yet.

If the link above dies, contact me and I can provide a copy.


==== EDITING ====

Project .rmf files can be saved and loaded from the file menu.

Select target device in Options > Device. Here mainly interested in MSM6650/53.
Leave Osc settings at the default (CR, 256kHz).
Changing the device settings will clear all sound data so do this first!

Set output format to HEX & Binary in Options > Setup.

To load sound files, double click a row and select a suitable .wav/.pcm.
44100Hz files load but will become 8000Hz. Stereo files will not load.

Each row in the window corresponds to a sample.
Sample parameters can be edited by double clicking any column.

User Address column maps to edit ROM / phrase control table.
Phrase column maps to the phrase sample number. They are auto assigned but can be manually set.
Duplicate User Address or duplicate Phrase with different data is invalid.

Up to 8 rows can be joined under the same user address by selecting multiple rows with Shift/Ctrl
and Right Click > Joining. Joined set of rows with User Address = 1 and Phrase 4,5,6 means play
samples 4,5,6 when address 1 triggered. A joined set can be separated with Right Click > Partition.

Once you have a joined set you can also add silences and beeps. These can't be added outside sets
because they are only supported in the newer devices with edit ROM / phrase control table functions.
You can create a set by copying a row, changing User Address, joining, then removing the second row.

The melody function in the 665x series is not supported at all by this software!


==== ROM EXPORT ====

To export a ROM, use Create > ROM File or the blue chip button.

Granular noise reduction is a preprocessing step on audio data when exporting.
It is suggested to disable this for testing, especially for round-trip tests.

When setting the output file, be aware the program will convert to uppercase and may append numbers.
It will then ask for a ROM Size, I suggest 1 Mbit for MSM6653.

The output will consist of
- One or more .HEX files, each the selected size, with numbers appended if there are multiple files.
- A .BIN file with the complete data. NOT the same size as device ROM, will be some multiple of the selected size.
- A .INF file describing the memory map of the data and device parameters.
